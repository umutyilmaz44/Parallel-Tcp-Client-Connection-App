# ParallelTcpClientConnectionApp
* The app is example of that dynamic defined tcp clients connect via parallel.
* First of all, you should enter the **ip** and **port** information on the screen where you want to establish a socket connection.
* Then, by clicking the **Connect** button, it will try to connect simultaneously to the defined ip-port end connections.
* In each line, the related ip-port connection status will be displayed as a picture and description.
* You must click the **Disconnect** button to close all connections.
* For successful connections, the **Send Data** button will be active.
* You can send data to the terminals with active connection by clicking the **Send Data** button.
* A ping-pong-like structure has been created to check whether the connection is broken or not in the application.
